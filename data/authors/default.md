Welcome to Book Talk Today Podcast. A podcast that interviewers authors to uncover the ideas and principles behind their books.

My name is Aun Abdi. I’m a Software Engineer and Content Creator based out of London, UK. The main reason behind creating BTT was a desire to learn more about a topic from the author. When I enjoy learning from a book I often find myself wanting to know how and why an author came to write the book. You can message the author in the hopes they reply, however, I found myself wanting to share these conversations in the hopes others would be interested too. And thus BTT was born.

If you’re an author or publisher interested in joining the podcast please reach out to me and I would be more than happy to have you on. If you’re an interested listener please subscribe to our channels and leave a review.

Thanks for all your support. Happy reading.

Aun Abdi
